# Norton
A PC/XBOX 360 game developed using Microsoft's XNA Engine

Norton is developed in Microsoft's XNA Game Studio using C#.
The game can be played on PC with a mousea and keyboard or you can plug in your own XBox 360 controller.
You can also load it on to your XBox 360 using XNA Game Studio however the game is kinda slow, we are still working on making it more efficient.
